# LFS_Synthesis
LFS_Synthesis data &amp; code

This code is shared with absolutely zero warranty and without interpretation. Use at your own risk.
I have tried to include useful comments in the code, but it is highly likely that commenting is incomplete.
For now, the data that goes with the code will only be provided upon request.  Data will be made available for download with the code at a later date.

Logistics:
The model code (LFS_dist_models.R) depends on the data code (LFS_data_steps.R) to read the data and do some necessary formatting.
The model code also requires a shapefile of the regions for making summary maps.
